Larger mesh gill net; likely for demersal or pelagic shark; typically blue in colour and up to 350mm mesh size with twine of 3.75mm. Tightly twisted plastic net with most samples found attached to other nets so possibly wings or outer body parts of a demersal fish trawl (shark fishing). The 4 and 5 strand samples have been positively identified as used by Chinese and Korean vessels using Korean made nets.
