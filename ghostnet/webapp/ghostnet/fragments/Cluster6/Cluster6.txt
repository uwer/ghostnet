Cluster 6

Slightly heavier twine and fine- medium mesh net; typically green in colour; mesh of 25-57mm. Double stranded, hard plastic net construction. Cod end for Australian trawl targeting shrimp/prawns. Presumed to be 2 double twine nets with 3mm each. Before 1992 the twine was lighter due to vessels towing 4 nets rather than the bigger 2 nets.
