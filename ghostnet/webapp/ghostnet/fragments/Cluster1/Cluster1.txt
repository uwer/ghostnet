Cluster 1
Twine is twisted, hard plastic. Mesh size 25-41 mm with 2mm thick twine. Typically cod-ends for twin rig otter board trawls for vessels, generally <250 gross tonnes. Slight variations in twine density would be associated with differences in overall size of the gear depending on vessel HP.
