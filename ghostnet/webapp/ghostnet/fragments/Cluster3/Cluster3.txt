Cluster 3

Fine mesh nets, generally drift or gill nets; typically green in colour; mesh size 74-95mm. 1mm twine, mostly made of loosely twisted plastic that gives the net material a soft feel. Surface pelagic drift nets used mostly by fishers targeting shark, mackerel and other pelagic species. Distinctive by torpedo floats along head rope.
